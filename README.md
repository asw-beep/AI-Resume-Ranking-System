# AI Resume Ranking System 🚀

An AI-powered resume ranking system that evaluates and ranks resumes against a given job description using NLP and semantic similarity techniques.  
Built as an end-to-end applied AI project and deployed via a Gradio interface.

> ⚠️ This project is designed to run on **Google Colab**. The full pipeline executes from a single notebook.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Recruiters often receive hundreds of resumes for a single role, making manual shortlisting time-consuming and subjective.  
This project automates the resume screening process by:

- Understanding job descriptions
- Extracting semantic meaning from resumes
- Ranking resumes based on relevance using NLP techniques

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 📄 Resume parsing and preprocessing  
- 🧠 NLP-based semantic similarity scoring  
- 📊 Automated resume ranking  
- 🎛️ Interactive **Gradio web interface**  
- ☁️ Runs entirely on **Google Colab** (no local setup required)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Google Colab**
- **NLP / Text Embeddings**
- **scikit-learn**
- **Gradio**
- **Pandas, NumPy**

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Project (Recommended)

### 👉 Option 1: Run on Google Colab (Best Experience)

1. Open the notebook directly in Colab:
   
   👉 **[Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xVyaolqxQ5z0Ft2z8WhcCB4RjW0D3LW3?usp=sharing)**

2. **Run all cells from top to bottom**  
   (`Runtime → Run all`)

3. Once execution completes, a **Gradio interface link** will appear at the bottom.

4. Upload resumes and enter a job description to see ranked results.

> ⚠️ The entire notebook must be executed for the Gradio app to function correctly.
